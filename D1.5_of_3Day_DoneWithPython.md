# Object-Oriented Python



### Basic Class

Let’s create a class to represent courses at Stanford! Copy the following into a file and save it as `courses.py`.

```
class StanfordCourse:
    def __init__(self, department, code, title):
        self.department = department
        self.code = code
        self.title = title
```

You can assume that all arguments to this constructor will be strings.

We can import this class definition and create an instance of the class in the interacitve interpreter, by running:

```
$ python3
>>> from courses import StanfordCourse
>>> stanford_python = StanfordCourse("CS", "41", "hap.py code: The python programming language")
```

We can access attributes of `stanford_python`, our instance object:

```
>>> from courses import StanfordCourse
>>> stanford_python = StanfordCourse("CS", "41", "hap.py code: the python programming language")
>>> stanford_python.title
'hap.py code: the python programming language'
>>> stanford_python.code
"41"
>>>
```

### 继承（Inheritance）

Let’s add inheritance by creating a `StanfordCSCourse` class that takes an additional parameter `recorded` that defaults to `False`

Write the following code snippet in the `courses.py` file:

```
class StanfordCSCourse(StanfordCourse):
    def __init__(self, department, code, title, recorded=False):
        super().__init__(department, code, title)
        self.is_recorded = recorded
```

The `super()` call is a little bit of magic to us at this point - it builds an object described by the superclass, allowing us to call the `__init__` method on that object.

Assess the following equalities in your Python interpreter. You can import both classes by running either one of the following lines in your terminal

```
>>> from courses import StanfordCourse, StanfordCSCourse
>>> a = StanfordCourse("CS", "106A", "Programming Methodology")
>>> b = StanfordCSCourse("CS", "106B", "Programming Abstractions")
>>> x = StanfordCSCourse("CS", "106X", "Programming Abstractions", recorded=True)
>>> a.code
"106A"
>>> b.code
"106b"
```

What is the output of the statements below?

```
type(a)
isinstance(a, StanfordCourse)
isinstance(b, StanfordCourse)
isinstance(x, StanfordCourse)
isinstance(x, StanfordCSCourse)
type(a) == type(b)
type(b) == type(x)
a == b
b == x
```

### Additional Attributes

Let's add more functionality to the `StanfordCourse` class!

* Add a attribute `students` to the instances of the `StanfordCourse` class that tracks whether students are present. Initially, students should be an empty set.
* Create a method `mark_attendance(*students)` that takes a variadic number of `students` and marks them as present.
* Create a method `is_present(student)` that takes a student’s name as a parameter and returns `True` if the student is present and `False` otherwise.

### Implementing Prerequisites

Now, we'll focus on `StanfordCSCourse`. We want to implement functionality to determine if one computer science course is a prerequisite of another. In our implementation, we will assume that the ordering for courses is determined first by the numeric part of the course code: for example, `140` comes before `255`. If there is a tie, the ordering is determined by the default string ordering of the letters that follow. For example, `106A < 106B`. After implementing, you should be able to see:

```
>>> cs106a = StanfordCourse("CS", "106A", "Programming Methodology")
>>> cs106b = StanfordCSCourse("CS", "106B", "Programming Abstractions")
>>> cs107 = StanfordCSCourse("CS", "107", "Computer Organzation and Systems")
>>> cs110 = StanfordCSCourse("CS", "110", "Principles of Computer Systems")
>>> cs110 > cs106b
True
>>> cs107 > cs110
False
```

To accomplish this, you will need to implement a magic method `__le__` that will add functionality to determine if a course is a prerequisite for another course. Read up on [total ordering](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering) to figure out what `__le__` should return based on the argument you pass in.

To give a few hints on how to add this piece of functionality might be implemented, consider how you might extract the actual `int` number from the course code attribute.

Additionally, you should implement a `__eq__` on `StanfordCourse`s. Two classes are equivalent if they are in the same department and have the same course code: the course title doesn't matter here.

#### Sorting

Now that we've written a `__le__` method and an `__eq__` method, we've implemented everything we need to speak about an "ordering" of `StanfordCourse`s. Using the [`functools.total_ordering` decorator](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering), decorate the class so that all of the comparison methods are implemented. You should be able to run

```
# Let's make CS106A a CS course
cs106a = StanfordCSCourse("CS", "106A", "Programming Methodology")

courses = [cs110, cs106a, cs107, cs106b]
courses.sort()
courses # => [cs106a, cs106b, cs107, cs110]
```

### Instructors (challenge)

Allow the class to take a splat argument `instructors` that will take any number of strings and store them as a list of instructors.

Modify the way you track attendance in the `StanfordCourse` class to map a Python date object (you can use the `datetime` module) to a data structure tracking what students are there on that day.

### Catalog

Implement a class called `CourseCatalog` that is constructed from a list of `StanfordCourse`s. Write a method for the `CourseCatalog` which returns a list of courses in a given department. Additionally, write a method for `CourseCatalog` that returns all courses that contain a given piece of search text in their title. The skeleton will look like the following:

```
class CourseCatalog:
    def __init__(self, courses):
        pass
       
    def courses_by_department(self, department_name):
        pass
        
    def courses_by_search_term(self, search_snippet):
        pass
```

Feel free to implement any other interesting methods you'd like.
